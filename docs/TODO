* OgreOpcode TODO List
*************************

--------------
High priority: 
--------------

1) Make OgreOpcode use Eihort by default.

2) Either move OPCODE directly into OgreOpcode (to remove the extra project/build), or just statically link to it.

3) Fix the resource management bugs which causes OgreOpcode to goof up when objects are removed, destroyed, added and created during run-time..

  I've restructured the layout for the source code which should make it easier to compile on Windows using Visual Studio or Visual dot NET.
	I'm busy writing the SCons scripts for Opcode. I have yet to include a binary version of SCons for SCons-less operating systems.
